									<p>Total Revenue = 16.06Million, Churn Total = 2.86Million</br>
										Total Monthly Charges = 455.63K, Churn Total = 139,13k which is about 30% of the total monthly charges</br> 
										Total Revenue Last Month = 31k, Churn Total = 22k which is about 71% of the total revenue that of customers that left last month (Which is not good and need process improvement to recover lost customers and revenue to reduce monthly left customer revenue to at least 10% -15%)</br>
										Total Customers = 7,031K, Churn customers = 1,869k which is about 27% of the total customers</br>
										Total Customers Left Last Month = 380 which 5.40% of Overall Customers including churn and 20.33% of overall total churn customers.</p>
										<p><h4>Suggestion 1</h4> Before any strategic planning I suggest that all churn total by tenure period should be derived, take average,
											 then compare which tenure impacted the most and execute process improvement to reduce the retention rate to at least  the lowest
											  tenure with total churn customers.</p>
										<p><h4> Findings by Demographic </h4>

											Total Customers = 7,031k</br>
											Female = 3,482k (49.52%) >> Churn Total = 930</br>
											Male = 3,549k (50.48%) >> Churn Total = 939</br>
											
											Female gender contributed the most to the churn rate but with a very little margin in the sense of customers and Revenue.</br></p>
											
											<p>Total Revenue = 16.06Million</br>
												Female = 7.95Million --- Churn rate = 1.35Million</br>
												Male = 8.10Million --- Churn rate = 1.51Million</br>
											
											Revenue by Last month = 31k</br>
												Female = 14,789k --- Churn rate = 11,103k</br>
												Male = 16,128k --- Churn rate = 11,011k</br>
											
											The ratio of total revenue by churn customer last month is proportional higher than that of total customer revenue that didnâ€™t churn last month (71:29) % which Male contributed the higher revenue by overall customers that left last month. However, Female contributed the highest revenue by churn customers that left last month.
											</p>
										<p><h4>Customers by Partners to Dependents insights.</h4></br>

											No-Partner/No-Dependents Customers = 3,280 (46.65%)</br>
											Churn = 1,123 (60%)</br>
											No-Partner/Dependents Customers = 359 (5.11%)</br>
											Churn = 77 (4.12%)</br>
											Partner/Dependents Customers = 1,740 (25%)</br>
											Churn = 249 (13.32%)</br>
											Partner/No-Dependents Customers = 1,652 (24%)</br>
												Churn = 420 (23%)</br>
											
											The risk of losing high number of customers fall at customers with no partner and dependents (because 30% them churns) and also
											 Partner/ No-Dependents (Because 25% of them churns) while the other have low risk compare the rate of churn overall customers in 
											 their categories.</p>
										<p><h4>Suggestion:</h4> from this analysis it indicate that most Partners with Partner/Dependent or No-Dependents are most loyal,
											so the marketing team should target these type of customers during acquisition or re-approach churn customers later when they
											have partners.</p>
										<p><h4>Customers Account Info Insights</h4> 

											The highest generating and most preferred payment method is Electronic Check due to churn and the highest generating payment method
											 for Non-Churn customer is Bank Transfer (Re** maybe prescribe Bank transfer payment method to churn customers)</br>
											
											<h4>Contract type Breakdown by customer Tenure</h4>
											
											Month to Month = Most Customers preferred this customer contract type within the first ten years (1,827) and then continue dropping
											 every 10years till year 72 and marking total of 3,874) over 50% of overall customers.</br>
											
											Churn Month to Month = Exhibited same pattern with highest cumulative total of (1655) across different contract type. (Re** recommend
											other contract type and Discounted service for their tenure loyalty)</br>
											
											One year = In this situation customers preference for this contract type increase over every ten years (1st ten years = 87 and last
											10 years = 268) with the total of 1,472</br>
											
											Churn One year = Exhibited same pattern but churn cumulative total is very low compared the overall total of customer of under one year contract type.</br>
											
											Two years = This contract type has the same behaviours as one year contract type but cumulative total of 1,685</br>
											
											Churn two years = Exhibited same pattern but churn cumulative total is very low compared the overall total of customer of under two-year contract type.</br>
											</p>
											<h4>Paperless Distribution by Customers</h4></br> 

												Generally, and even churns customers mostly preferred paperless billing.</br>
												
												Payment Method Breakdown by Customer Tenure 
												
												Electronic Check and Mailed Check = Exhibited the same pattern whereby the short term (first 10 years) exhibited the most accumulated
												customers before dropping drastically the next 2ND ten years and steadily drop through the remaining longer tenure customers.</br>
												
												Churn Electronic Check and Mailed check = Most churn Customers are from this payment method while dropping drastically across longer 
												term customers (Suggestion*** Reduce the number of churn customer at early tenure)</br>
												
											<p>Bank Transfer and Credit Card = exhibited more increase in preferred payment method for long term customers</p></br>
												
												Churn Bank transfer and Credit Card = This exhibited same pattern with churn electronic check and Mailed check even though there was not
												drastically drop across the longer tenure. However, they both have very low cumulative total.

												
												
											<h4>Customers Services Subscription Type</h4>
												
												Total Admin Ticket = 3,621K</br>
												Total Tech Ticket = 2,955K</br>
												
												<p><h4>Customers with Services Subscription by Gender </h4></p>
												
												Tech support, Streaming Movies, Online Security, Online Backup, Multiple = The following services are slightly patronised more by female than male customers while the rest are patronise more by male customers 
												
												While Male customer slightly higher across all services that for customers without service subscription by gender breakdown 
												
												Also customer subscribe for internet services and Phone services while other services have higher cumulative total of unsubscribe customers 
												
												<h4>Customers Membership Categories</h4>
												
												Entry Level = 1service</br>
												Basic = 2 Services</br>
												Standard = 3 Services</br>
												Bronze = 4 Services</br>
												Silver = 5 Services</br>
												Gold = 6 Services</br> 
												Diamond = 7 Services</br>
												Platinum = 8 Services</br>
												Executive = 9 Services </br>
												 
												
												<p>Higher cumulative total of customer member categories is from (Entry Level, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Standard and Basic members). However, entry level, Bronze, Standard and Basic member mostly lasted between 1 to 20 tenure and Diamond, platinum and Executive members generate most customers between 60 to 72 Tenure.</br>
												
												Churn = Most membership have their churn customers subscriptions lasted at early tenure period, Platinum have most of his churn customer lasted until later tenure and Executive have no churn customers at first 4 10years tenure. However, most churn cumulative total by membership are as follow; standard, Bronze, Silver, Basic, Gold, Diamond, Entry Level, and Platinum.</br>
												
												<h4>Suggestion:</h4>
												 Further Analysis to see the cumulative revenue by each churn membership revenue to the membership cumulative total (churn & Un-churn) to see members that are in accumulation of greater loss of revenue. Good thing is that the higher-class membership have low churn rate meaning we are not losing most of the very valuable customers.
